# Third-party notices

These notices cover the third-party material in this repository. Anything
built over the engine and shipped as a binary carries the same obligations to
its own readers, and discharges them wherever that binary can — so a change
here is a change there too.

These notices do not change the licence of Fotufilm-authored material; see
[LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).

## Halide

The image pipeline is written against Halide and compiled by it. On macOS and
Linux `FotufilmHalide` links `libHalide` and JITs; where no compiler can ship
alongside the binary — iOS, and the Resolve plugin — the kernels are generated
ahead of time and linked in as static archives, which brings part of the
Halide runtime into the shipped binary. Halide is Copyright (c) 2012-2020 MIT
CSAIL, Google, Facebook, Adobe,
NVIDIA CORPORATION, and other contributors, and is distributed under the MIT
License: <https://github.com/halide/Halide>.

Because an ahead-of-time binary carries Halide runtime code, the MIT
copyright and permission notice travels with it and must be reproduced in full
wherever that binary is distributed. No part of Halide is vendored into this repository; the build fetches
it from the system (`brew install halide`).

## Measured-reflectance recovery prior

`Sources/FotufilmCore/Resources/rec2020-reflectance-prior.coeff` is a derived
posterior table fitted by `tools/spectral/generate_reflectance_prior.py`. The
generator resamples, bounds and statistically aggregates the following open
measurement sets; the original records and archives are downloaded into a
local cache and are not copied into this repository:

The generated table is an adaptation: measurements are resampled to the
engine's 41 bands, implausible records are rejected, small out-of-range values
are clipped, and the resulting mean and covariance, with a curvature penalty,
drive bounded quadratic optimisations over the Rec.2020 anchor faces. The coefficient file is recorded by hash in `SOURCE_ASSETS.json`. The CC BY 4.0 licence is at
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.

## OFX image effect API

`resolve/openfx/` holds ten headers from the OpenFX image effect API, the
interface the DaVinci Resolve plugin is written against. They are Copyright
(c) 2003-2015 The Open Effects Association Ltd and OpenFX contributors, and
distributed under the BSD
3-Clause License: <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openfx>. Each
file carries the full copyright, conditions and disclaimer in its own header
comment, unmodified. The base API headers are from `OFX_Release_1_4_TAG`; the
colour exchange and native-config headers are the OFX 1.5 versions distributed
with the DaVinci Resolve 21 SDK.

The API is headers only: there is no OpenFX code in the built plugin, which
implements the interface rather than linking an implementation of it. It is
also the only notice here that applies to the plugin alone — nothing in
`resolve/openfx/` reaches the library or the CLI.

## rawtoaces camera spectral sensitivity data

`Sources/FotufilmCore/CameraProfiles/` holds measured camera spectral
sensitivity datasets copied from the Academy Software Foundation's
rawtoaces data repository
(<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rawtoaces-data>, commit
`e9b8503cf8a0641f40e5345d9757bde60c15f423`, files unmodified). The data is
distributed under the Apache License 2.0; the licence text is reproduced in
full at `Sources/FotufilmCore/CameraProfiles/LICENSE`, and each JSON file
declares `"license": "Apache-2.0"` in its own header.

The directory ships as a copied resource, so the datasets — and the licence
file beside them — travel inside every binary that links `FotufilmCore`. The
apps' acknowledgements screens carry the attribution and point at that
bundled copy of the licence.

## Film profiles and print receivers

`Sources/FotufilmCore/Stocks/` holds the released film profiles and the
project-authored synthetic examples. The print receivers in `PrintPaperTables.swift`
and the `*PaperSpectra.swift` / `*PrintSpectra.swift` files are this project's own
digitisations of the manufacturers' publicly published datasheets. The datasheets
themselves are not redistributed. Product names identify which material each
measurement describes and are the trademarks of their respective owners.

The one table here that is not our own measurement is the xenon projector spectrum,
covered below.

## Kinoton 75P projector spectrum (colour-science)

`Illuminant.measuredXenonProjection` in `Sources/FotufilmCore/Illuminant.swift` is
transcribed from `colour.SDS_LIGHT_SOURCES["Kinoton 75P"]` in the colour-science
library (<https://github.com/colour-science/colour>). Upstream, the measurement's
provenance is a private communication (Jim Houston to Thomas Mansencal, 2015).

colour-science is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License. Its copyright notice,
conditions and disclaimer are reproduced here in full, which is what the licence

Naming colour-science and its upstream source is factual attribution. Under the
licence's third clause it is not an endorsement by the Colour Developers or their
contributors.

## CIE colorimetric data

The 10 nm samples in `SpectralModel.swift` are drawn from the CIE open data
sets “CIE 1931 colour-matching functions, 2 degree observer” and “CIE standard
illuminant D65”, published by the International Commission on Illumination.

## App Store badge

`docs/assets/download-on-the-app-store.svg` is the unmodified "Download on the
App Store" badge artwork that Apple provides for linking to an app's App Store
listing, used here under Apple's App Store Marketing Guidelines. Apple, the
Apple logo and App Store are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S.
and other countries and regions.

## Browser RAW decoder

The browser RAW decoder is built from unmodified [LibRaw 0.22.2 source](https://www.libraw.org/data/LibRaw-0.22.2.tar.gz),
Copyright (C) 2008–2025 LibRaw LLC and the contributors listed in its `COPYRIGHT`.
Fotufilm distributes this component under LibRaw's CDDL 1.0 option. The build
copies `LICENSE.CDDL` and `COPYRIGHT` beside the decoder in `web/public/raw`;
they must remain in deployments. LibRaw's source and individual source-file
notices are available in the linked release archive. The wrapper and build
recipe are in `web/engine/raw_wasm.cpp` and `tools/build-raw-wasm.sh`.

The decoder also uses Emscripten's libjpeg and zlib ports. This software is
based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group. The build copies
the ports' licence notices into the same deployment directory. LibRaw,
libjpeg and zlib sources and build outputs are downloaded into ignored build
and toolchain caches; they are not vendored into the engine repository.

## Browser OpenEXR decoder

The browser uses the Three.js 0.186.0 EXRLoader and its bundled fflate implementation,
licensed under MIT. Three.js is Copyright © 2010–2026 Three.js authors; fflate is
Copyright © 2020 Arjun Barrett. See [the MIT notice](licenses/BROWSER-EXR-MIT.txt).
The decoder is installed from npm; its generated browser bundle stays in deployment assets.

## Browser video

The browser video reader, WebCodecs integration, audio conversion and muxers use
Mediabunny 1.56.1, Copyright © Vanilagy, under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
The library is used without modification. Its corresponding source is available
at <https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny/tree/v1.56.1> and in the
[mediabunny 1.56.1 npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mediabunny/v/1.56.1).
See [the MPL-2.0 license](licenses/MEDIABUNNY-MPL-2.0.txt). These terms cover the
library; they do not cover rendered videos.

The optional software HEVC decoder uses **@hevcjs/core 1.4.5** by Thibaut Lion,
under the [MIT license](licenses/HEVCJS-MIT.txt). Its unmodified WebAssembly
decoder and loader are bundled from the pinned npm dependency and run in a
worker when native decoding cannot expose camera code values. Source:
https://github.com/lid-labs/hevc.js and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hevcjs/core/v/1.4.5.
The license is included in browser builds at `licenses/HEVCJS-MIT.txt`.


## Browser Swift profile builder

The browser profile worker runs the Swift 6.3.3 runtime and Foundation compiled
to WebAssembly. See [the Apache 2.0 license with Runtime Library Exception](licenses/SWIFT-APACHE-2.0-RUNTIME.txt).
It uses **@bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim 0.4.2**, without modification, under
[its MIT license](licenses/BROWSER-WASI-SHIM-MIT.txt). Source:
<https://github.com/bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim>. Both notices are included in browser builds.

## Linux desktop image libraries

The Linux AppImage (`cef/package-appimage.sh`) carries unmodified shared libraries from the
distribution it is built on, because a desktop may lack them: LibRaw (LGPL-2.1 or CDDL-1.0),
libheif and libde265 (LGPL-3.0-or-later), libaom and dav1d (BSD-2-Clause, with the Alliance for
Open Media patent licence for libaom), libpng (libpng licence), Little CMS (MIT), OpenEXR and
Imath (BSD-3-Clause), and GCC's libgomp (GPL-3.0 with the GCC Runtime Library Exception). It also
carries **libjpeg-turbo 3.2.0** (IJG and BSD-3-Clause; this software is based in part on the work
of the Independent JPEG Group), built unmodified from
<https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases/tag/3.2.0> by
`cef/build-libjpeg-turbo-linux.sh`. The engine links them dynamically, so each can be replaced
with a compatible build. The packaging script copies each package's copyright file, and
libjpeg-turbo's `LICENSE.md` and `README.ijg`, into the image under `usr/share/doc/`. The source
of the distribution's libraries is its source package of the version the image was built with
(for Ubuntu 24.04, <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libheif> and the matching pages for the
others). The image carries no GPL component: the HEVC encoder (x265) and libtiff come from the
system.

## Material Symbols

The browser editor bundles selected Material Symbols Outlined SVG paths by Google,
under the Apache License 2.0. Source: [google/material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons),
commit `27e9ef1dbeedc13d682fece4a58e1eda4cb0961a`. Paths are extracted unchanged
into `web/src/material-symbols.json` by `tools/update-material-symbols.py`.
The full license is in [licenses/MATERIAL-SYMBOLS-APACHE-2.0.txt](licenses/MATERIAL-SYMBOLS-APACHE-2.0.txt)
and is included in browser builds. Icons are served locally; no font service is required.
